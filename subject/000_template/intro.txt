I will provide you 
**Quansheng Chirp Data Information:**

1. The data provided is in Quansheng Chirp CSV format, used for configuring Quansheng radios e.g. the Quansheng UV-K5, UV-K6, UV-K5(8), and UV-5R Plus.
2. Each row represents a memory location or channel in the radio's memory.
3. Parameters include:
   - Location: Memory location number.
      A Quansheng radio has 200 memory locations.
   - Name: Channel name or identifier.
   - Frequency: Operating frequency in MHz.
   - Duplex: Duplex setting (- for simplex, + for positive offset, R for reverse, T for transmit only).
   - Offset: Offset in MHz for duplex channels.
   - Tone: Tone mode (Tone for CTCSS/PL tone, Tone->Tone for tone squelch).
   - rToneFreq: Receive tone frequency (for CTCSS/PL).
   - cToneFreq: Transmit tone frequency (for CTCSS/PL).
   - Other parameters: DtcsCode, DtcsPolarity, RxDtcsCode, CrossMode, Mode, TStep, Skip, Power, Comment, URCALL, RPT1CALL, RPT2CALL, DVCODE.
4. The Power parameter indicates the configured power level in the Quansheng radio, not the power of the repeater.
5. The Duplex parameter indicates whether the offset is positive or negative, or if the channel is simplex.
6, Numbers provided in the CSV file are exact numbers as if they had many additional zeros ( 000000000000 ) appended .
     Therefore 145.6  145.6125 and 145.6375 are all different frequencies  


7. There are two scan lists (Scanlist 1 and Scanlist 2) in the Quansheng radio, and each channel can be assigned to one or both lists, or none.
8. The radio also features an FM radio for public radio reception, 

And another software variant utilizes an XML format for configuration, including settings for the FM radio (7) and scan lists (6). The Quansheng Chirp Data does not provide this.

Please focus on the columns 'Frequency,' 'Duplex,' and 'Offset' in the CSV file I've provided. Ensure you understand that 'Duplex' indicates whether the offset is positive, negative, or missing. Also, pay attention to the terminology used, such as 'Tone,' which refers to the tone type. Remember to provide accurate information based solely on the data provided in the CSV file. Thank you for your attention to detail!
