Examples to incorporate instructions into your communication with ChatGPT:

"Please focus on the columns 'Frequency,' 'Duplex,' and 'Offset' in the CSV file I've provided.
Ensure you understand that 'Duplex' indicates whether the offset is positive, negative, or missing.
Also, pay attention to the terminology used, such as 'Tone,' which refers to the tone type.
Remember to provide accurate information based solely on the data provided in the CSV file.
Thank you for your attention to detail!"

"ChatGPT, please note that when I include the '!' symbol in our conversation, it signifies
 important instructions or data that you should pay close attention to. 
 For example, if I start a message with '!', it means I'm providing relevant information or
 commands that you need to remember or act upon.
 Please ensure you respond accordingly and incorporate this information into your responses.
 Thank you for your cooperation!"
